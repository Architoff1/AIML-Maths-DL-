# AIML-Maths-DL-

This repo is for learning AIML from start to end with maths and deep learning concepts nothing will be left over.

""""


    Mathematics: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics are integrated throughout the mastery track alongside syllabus topics, ensuring strong foundational skills to understand and build AI/ML/DL models.

    Computer Science Fundamentals: Core AI topics like search, logic, knowledge representation, optimization, data structures, and algorithms are addressed early in the plan via the CS50 AI introduction and reinforced throughout.

    Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: Your syllabus topics are fully covered starting immediately with ANN, covering perceptrons, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, and more, alongside supplementary foundational and advanced ML concepts.

    Deep Learning & Neural Networks: Deep dive into architectures, training, regularization, and practical implementation projects to help internalize concepts deeply.

    Natural Language Processing & Generative AI: Included progressively, with recommended resources and projects aligned to your pace and syllabus progression.

    Practical Projects & Assessments: Hands-on coding, mini-projects, and quizzes integrated weekly/monthly to reinforce learning and build real-world skills.

    Resources & Tools: Carefully chosen high-quality and free/paid resources, including videos, textbooks, online courses, and research papers aligned with each topic and learning step.

    Adaptability & Classroom Sync: The plan starts now with ANN as your professor suggests, seamlessly blending classroom lectures and independent mastery work without losing any foundational or advanced coverage.

# I mean update our whole plan it looks like in the plan we only have the syllabus related planning what about the field mastery and everything

Here is your **fully upgraded study plan** that integrates both your syllabus (starting with ANN) and a parallel mastery path for the entire AIML field—so you gain practical, in-depth expertise, not just exam preparation. This plan balances classroom progression and full-spectrum AIML mastery, with the best resources for each area.
